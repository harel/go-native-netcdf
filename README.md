# go-native-netcdf

## Introduction

This is a native implementation of NetCDF in the Go language. It supports the CDF
file format fully, and has limited support for the HDF5 format. It's not a wrapper.
There's no C or C++ code underneath this. It is pure Go code. It benefits from the
the sandboxing and garbage collection that Go provides, so is safer to use in a production
environment.

The API is mainly intended for reading files, though there is support for writing CDF files.
To read files, please use the generic *Open* and *New()* interface, rather than any lower
layer interfaces.

The goal of the API is to be easy to use, and some functionality may be compromised because
of that.

## Mapping of Types

Most types are what you what you would expect and map one-to-one to Go language types.
The only tricky ones are *bytes, unsigned bytes and strings*. The NetCDF *byte* type is
signed and the Go language *byte* type is unsigned, so the proper mapping is for NetCDF *bytes*
to become Go *int8s*. Conversely, the NetCDF *ubyte* becomes the Go *uint8*.

The *char* type in NetCDF is meant for strings, but *char* is a scalar in NetCDF and Go has
no scalar character type, just a *string* type to represent character strings. So, the
mapping of NetCDF char is to Go string as the closest fit. Scalar characters in NetCDF
will be returned as strings of length one.  Scalar characters cannot be written to NetCDF
with this API; they will always be written as strings of length one.

Also note, that while it is normal to use the *int* type in Go, this type cannot be written
to NetCDF. *int32* should be used instead.


| NetCDF type      | Go type |
|------------------|---------|
| byte             | int8    |
| ubyte            | uint8   |
| char             | string  |
| short            | int16   |
| ushort           | uint16  |
| int              | int32   |
| uint             | uint32  |
| int64            | int64   |
| uint64           | uint64  |
| float            | float32 |
| double           | float64 |


## Examples

### Reading a NetCDF file (CDF format)
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/harel/go-native-netcdf/netcdf"
)

func main() {
    // Open the file
    nc, err := netcdf.Open("data.nc")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer nc.Close()

    // Read the NetCDF variable from the file
    vr, _ := nc.GetVariable("latitude")
    if vr == nil {
        panic("latitude variable not found")
    }

    // Cast the data into a Go type we can use
    lats, has := vr.Values.([]float32)
    if !has {
        panic("latitude data not found")
    }
    for i, lat := range lats {
        fmt.Println(i, lat)
    }
}

```

### Reading a NetCDF file (HDF5 format)
It is similar, but supports subgroups.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/harel/go-native-netcdf/netcdf"
)

func main() {
    // Open the file
    ncf, err := netcdf.Open("data.nc")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer ncf.Close()

    // This is the only thing different about HDF5 from CDF
    // in this implementation.
    nc, err := ncf.GetGroup("/raw")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer nc.Close()

    // Read the NetCDF variable from the file
    vr, _ := nc.GetVariable("latitude")
    if vr == nil {
        panic("latitude variable not found")
    }

    // Cast the data into a Go type we can use
    lats, has := vr.Values.([]float32)
    if !has {
        panic("latitude data not found")
    }
    for i, lat := range lats {
        fmt.Println(i, lat)
    }
}

```

### Writing a CDF file
```go

package main

import (
  "github.com/harel/go-native-netcdf/netcdf/api"
  "github.com/harel/go-native-netcdf/netcdf/cdf"
  "github.com/harel/go-native-netcdf/netcdf/util"
)

func main() {
    cw, err := cdf.OpenWriter("newdata.nc")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    latitude := []float32{32.5, 64.1}
    dimensions := []string{"sounding_id"}
    attributes, err := util.NewOrderedMap(
        []string{"comment"},
        map[string]interface{}{"comment": "Latitude indexed by sounding ID"})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    variable := api.Variable{
        latitude,
        dimensions,
        attributes}
    err = cw.AddVar("latitude", variable)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    // Close will write out the data and close the file
    err = cw.Close()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

## Limitations on the CDF writer
Unlimited data types are not supported. The only exception is
that a one dimensional empty slice will be written out as unlimited, but
currently zero length. For writing out variables with dimensions greater than
one to work, extra information would need to be passed in to know the sizes of
the other dimensions, because they cannot be guessed based upon the information
in the slice. This doesn't seem like all that important of a feature though,
and it would clutter the UI, so it is not implemented.

## Some notes about the HDF5 code
The HDF5 code is quite hacky, but it has run though several unit tests, with good coverage,
and should be pretty solid. Performance has not been looked at yet though, so it is likely
slower than the alternative.

It's working well enough that I feel it is okay to publish it now. I'll continue to work
on it. I can clean up the code and make it run faster, for example. Feedback is welcome.

Some of the exotic HDF5 types are actually implemented, but the interfaces to them
mostly hidden. Variables of these types will get parsed and returned in
an unsupported format. If you want to play with it, fine. If there's enough demand,
I can expose the interfaces.

If you want to run the HDF5 unit tests, you will need *netcdf* installed and specifically,
the *ncdump* and *ncgen* commands. You will also need the HDF5 package, and specifically the
*h5dump* and *h5repack* commands. These are both available as an Ubuntu packages.

```console
$ sudo apt-get install netcdf-bin
$ sudo apt-get install hdf5-tools
```
